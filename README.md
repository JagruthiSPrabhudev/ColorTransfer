# ColorTransfer
An OpenCV project to change the image's color space from one to another. Given a source and target image, the program modifies the image's color space and displays the output image with the new color space. It makes use of the mean and standard deviation of the pixel intensities in the L*a*b* color space to transfer color from source to target.
